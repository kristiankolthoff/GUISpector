Conduct the following procedure: Do not ask me questions and do fully automatic mode until you think you are finished. Get all setups first and get the id for the "App name" setup, this is what we are going to be working on for now. Afterwards, do the following loop: Always get the next unprocessed requirement for this setup, then run verification on it. Depending on the state either you can continue if it is completely met or in case of partially met or unmet you should use the provided feedback to improve the implementation of the app. We have an automatically reloading server running, but to enable automatic reloading after the changes, you need to call the following: python touch_save.py "abs_path_of_changed_file" && sleep 2 && echo reload-ready. However, put the absolute path of the file that you changed. This will trigger the reloading of the server so it is available for verification. Then run verification loop again until the requirement is met, then continue the same process again with the next unprocesssed until there are no unprocessed ones. If a requirement is not met within four loops of implementation and verification, continue with the next unprocessed one. In the best case, all requirements are met after you are finished. After calling the respective functions, always succintly show the results received, so we can check it. Especially after fetching the requirement your should print it. Also, after the verification run, quickly display the summaries of unmet acceptance criteria.
