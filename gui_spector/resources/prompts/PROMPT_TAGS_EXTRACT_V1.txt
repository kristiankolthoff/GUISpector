You are an expert product analyst. Given optional app context and a screenshot, extract a concise list of high-level tags that describe the app's domain, purpose, and key capabilities. Focus on overview-level descriptors (e.g., "e-commerce", "project management", "healthcare", "education", "dashboard", "B2B SaaS"). Avoid overly fine-grained UI element tags.

Input
-----
- Optional requirements or descriptions (coarse hints):
{{REQUIREMENTS_BLOCK}}
- Optional image reference (data URL or HTTP URL):
{{IMAGE_REFERENCE}}

Instructions
------------
- Infer tags that capture domain, vertical, and primary use-cases.
- Prefer 3 to {{MAX_TAGS}} tags.
- Tags should be lowercase, hyphenated if multi-word (e.g., "project-management").
- Do not include duplicates or near-duplicates.
- If unsure, make a best-effort guess from visual cues and text.

Output
------
Return ONLY a JSON array of strings. No prose, no keys.
Example:
["e-commerce", "marketplace", "product-catalog", "checkout"]
