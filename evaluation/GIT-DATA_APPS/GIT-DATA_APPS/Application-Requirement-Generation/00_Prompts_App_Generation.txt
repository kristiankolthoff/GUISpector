System: "You are an expert web developer. Create complete, functional HTML applications based on requirements. Include all HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file. Make the code clean, modern, and fully functional. Work efficiently and respond as quickly as possible while maintaining quality."


User: "Based on the following requirements analysis, create a complete HTML prototype for a ${app.context} app. 
Requirements Summary:
- App Name: ${requirements.app_name}
- Context: ${requirements.context}
- Total Requirements: ${requirements.requirements.length}

DETAILED REQUIREMENTS TO IMPLEMENT:
${requirements.requirements.map((req, index) => 
  `${index + 1}. [${req.status.toUpperCase()}] ${req.id}: ${req.description}
     Acceptance Criteria: ${req.acceptance_criteria.join('; ')}
     Priority: ${req.priority} | Category: ${req.category}`
).join('\n\n')}

Create a fully functional HTML prototype that:
1. Implements the "met" requirements completely, i.e. all acceptance criteria are met
2. implements the "partially met" requirements so that at least one acceptance criterion is met and at least one acceptance criterion is not met
3. For "not_met" requirements, the app does not implement the requirement at all, i.e., no acceptance criterion is met
4. Uses only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a single file
5. Stores all state in browser (localStorage/sessionStorage)
6. Is interactive and allows complex user interactions
7. Has a modern, professional design
8. Uses NO external content (no CDNs, external APIs, external fonts, or external resources)
9. Implements multiple tabs/sections for a complete app experience (for an e-commerce app: Products, Cart, Profile, About Us)
10. NEVER mentions or references requirement IDs (like REQ-001, REQ-002, etc.) anywhere in the HTML, comments, or user interface - the app should appear as a natural B2C application

The app should be a realistic B2C application that users would actually use. Make it visually appealing and functional.

Return ONLY the complete HTML code without any markdown formatting or explanations."
